## Prof-X: AI Assisted Multi-view Persona Scraper for Any Researchers in Google Scholar
> Still a WIP now, use at your own risk!


### What Can Prof-X Do?
- [x] Automatically gather info about a list of researchers, by searching on Google Scholar
- [x] AI assisted research area summary
- [x] Publication information gathering and filtering
- [ ] Plotting citations versus years
- [ ] Publication and research progressing summary
- [ ] Author info & cross-page linking for publications


### Things you need
- An OpenAI API key
  - For AI assisted info gathering
  - Could be replaced by any local OpenAI-like API <WIP\>
  - But original OpenAI API is still recommended, as it could provide a far better result
- A Tencent Translate API Key
  - For translating article names into your language 
  - Chinese only currently :) Will add multilingual support after on


### Environment Preparation

First, install all the python requirements.
<pre><code>$ pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>

Then, rename `config_example.py` to `config.py`, and fill in the config parameters.

<pre><code>LOCAL_API_BASE = "https://my.api.link/v1"
REMOTE_API_BASE = "https://api.openai.com/v1"

OPENAI_KEY = "sk-AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA"
TX_SECRET_ID = "BBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB"
TX_SECRET_KEY = "CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC"
</code></pre>

### Running

<pre><code>$ python prof_x.py
</code></pre>

### One More Thing...
Declaration: Most of the codes were generated by GPT-3.5/GPT-4.

They work QUITE WELL!
